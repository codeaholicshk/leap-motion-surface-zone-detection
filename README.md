Surface Zone Measurement
=========================

Description
------

When we develop a touch surface with Leap Motion, we need to map the effective physical surface zone to the internal leap motion positioning system.

This script is getting the rectangular physical area corner coordinates: top left, top right, bottom right and bottom left.


Todo
------

* make the calibration function more object oriented instead of sharing global variables
* make the calibration independent and event based, so that other people can use this script as well
